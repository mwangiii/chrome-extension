# CHROME EXTENSION

In this project I build a color picker chrome extension using javascript

## STEPS I TOOK TO MAKE THE EXTESION

1. I wrote HTML,css and javascript code for the color picker
2. I created the neccesary files and modified the code to turn the color picker into an extension
3. I did upload the extension to the chrome web store then made the changes needed
